# New York City Blog
This project is a basic HTML webpage designed to showcase a blog about New York City. The webpage uses 
semantic HTML elements to create a structured layout with navigation, articles, images, a video, an 
audio clip, and more. The blog content highlights popular NYC attractions, food options, and unique 
features of the city.

## Credits
This project is based on an exercise from 
Codecademy.
While the task description and style.css file were provided by Codecademy, the HTML file and its structure 
were fully implemented by me.
